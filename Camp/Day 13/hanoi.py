"""The Tower of Hanoi (also called the Tower of Brahma or Lucas' Tower,[1] and sometimes pluralised) 
is a mathematical game or puzzle. 
It consists of three rods, and a number of disks of different sizes which can slide onto any rod. 
The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest 
at the top, thus making a conical shape.
The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:
  1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
  2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another 
  stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.
  3. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
  
This class will print ou the moves that it takes to solve the puzzle"""

# There seems to be a small typo in the last move. It should read, I believe, self.hanoi(n-1, c, a, b). Indeed, the first move puts the n-1 disks on the auxiliary rod (c); and the last move should therefore take the disks from that auxiliary rod (c) onto the destination rod (b).
# A new repository has been created for it, hosting both the following revised Python script and the corresponding Jupyter notebook.
